// My original impulse was to combine both search and filters into one interface,
// so that only one result set was returned using both criteria.  However, the
// instructions say to write a new resolver for search, and to implement filtering
// on the existing pokemonMany resolver.  This indicated to me that
// the queries should be run separately, with different sets of results.  Hence
// the option to choose EITHER search OR filter, but not use both at once.
//
// If you're interested, there is a branch called 'combined' on which I saved
// my work when I was implementing both search and filter as One Query To Rule
// Them All(tm), but it's not as functionally complete as this final version.

// A fuzzy search function leveraging the fuse.js library.

// I'm aware there are other libraries out there that may provide better, more
// accurate results, or are more performant, but my decision came down to overall
// popularity, recent maintenance, and documentation/ease of use.  Performance
// was not much of a consideration, given the dataset is only 150 records for
// this project.  Although I did find some complaints about fuse, they were years
// old, and more recent updates seemed to have covered these.
//
// I learned a lot in the process, and if I were to explore this more in-depth,
// I would try some of the other libraries like flexsearch.js, which uses contextual
// matching and appears to be far more performant, but has a steeper learning curve.
